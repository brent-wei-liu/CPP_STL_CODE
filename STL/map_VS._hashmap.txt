0. tr1/unordered_map is much faster than std::map based on my experiment
unordered_map_VS._map.cc

    time 10 times faster than std::map
    hash table uses 1.4G memory, map uses 1.6G memory;

1.map is impliment with red black tree
    insert/delete/query T(n) = O(log(n))
    
  hashmap  
    insert/delete/query T(n) = O(1)  

But log(n) is not so bad , we can query one key within 20 compare if
map.size() == 100W

2.map space using is O(n)
  hashmap use more space 
  
3.map maitain order of keys
  hashmap not
